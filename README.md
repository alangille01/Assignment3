# Employee Payroll Tracker

This employee tracker allows you to input the first and last names of the employee, as well as their salary. All inputted data will be formatted into a table.

This application can also compute the average salary of the employees and select a random employee from the list of employees.

If there is a non-integer value inputted as a salary, the application will default it to $0.
